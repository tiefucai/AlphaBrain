**AlphaBrain** is the world’s first all-in-one, open-source community for embodied intelligence, built to be ready out of the box. We unifies multiple VLA architectures, world model backbones, biologically-inspired learning algorithms, and reinforcement learning paradigms under a single, extensible framework. AlphaBrain brings embodied AI within everyone’s reach.

## 🔬 Key Features

AlphaBrain delivers five core capabilities on a single stack: the **VLA framework family** as the base, with **NeuroVLA / RLActionToken / Continual Learning / World Model** as composable capability modules. All capabilities share the same trainer, config system, and inference interface.

### VLA Frameworks

| Framework | Action Decoding | Typical Use |
|:----------|:----------------|:------------|
| **OFT** | MLP action head, parallel continuous decoding | Fast prototyping, baseline alignment |
| **GR00T** | System1 + Flow-Matching DiT System2 | High-precision manipulation, long-horizon planning |
| **PI** | Flow-Matching action prediction | Diffusion-style policies |
| **Adapter** | Lightweight Adapter decoding | Parameter-efficient fine-tuning |
| **NeuroVLA** | Bio-inspired spiking + STDP | Brain-inspired control |
| **CosmosPolicy** | Latent-space video diffusion | World-model-native policy |

### Brain-Inspired VLA (NeuroVLA + STDP)

NeuroVLA integrates spiking neural networks with biological learning rules into the VLA pipeline:

- **QFormer** extracts layer-wise action-relevant features from VLM hidden states;
- **SNN Action Head** with Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons for spike-based action prediction;
- **R-STDP Training** — Reward-Modulated Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity, supporting both hybrid (backprop + STDP) and pure STDP modes;
- **Online STDP** — Test-time adaptation with zero backpropagation, using self-supervised reward signals from environment interaction.

### RLActionToken Online RL Fine-tuning

A novel architecture that compresses VLA hidden states through an information bottleneck, followed by off-policy Actor-Critic reinforcement learning:
- **Encoder-Decoder**: Extracts a compact action token from the VLA's internal features to serve as the state representation for RL.
- **Two-Phase Training**: An initial adaptation stage to expose the action token → RL fine-tuning with a frozen VLA.
- **Low Resource Requirements**: The actual reinforcement learning gradient update phase involves a highly lightweight parameters.

### Continual Learning

Experience-replay-based continual learning for sequential task acquisition:

- **Incremental design** — all changes are additive, no modification to base training code;
- **LoRA integration** — parameter-efficient fine-tuning (~6% trainable params, ~3× memory savings);
- **Replay buffer** with configurable per-task capacity;
- **Cross-architecture adaptation** — the same CL algorithm drops directly onto different VLA frameworks.

### World Model Integration

Native support for 4 world model backbones plus full CosmosPolicy finetuning:

| Backbone | Params | Mode Name | Text Encoder |
|:---------|:-------|:----------|:-------------|
| V-JEPA 2.1 | ~1.8B | `world_model_vjepa` | T5-small |
| Cosmos Predict 2.5 | ~2.1B | `world_model_cosmos` | Reason1-7B |
| Cosmos Predict 2 | ~2.1B | `world_model_cosmos2` | T5-XXL |
| Wan 2.2 | ~5B | `world_model_wan` | UMT5-XXL |
